# Notes on InfoSec

## This repo contains only notes recorded while learning about Information Security

Currently, I am learning the concepts from the following. The list may keep changing.

- Cybrary's [ENTRY LEVEL CYBER SECURITY ANALYST](https://www.cybrary.it/learningpath/entry-level-cyber-security-analyst?i=AD52305) course.
- Reading CISA Review Manual 2014

- A couple of Youtube Videos

## TO DO

- Learn the functional concepts about the following.
	- Sqirrel SQL Client
	- Tableau Analytics
	- Hadoop on Horton Works

The plan is to create separate notes while learning from each of these resources.

> And the final goal is **Cyber Security Data Analysis using Python & R**
